Tom says: Try fading this sound in past the bulb hit and with lots of ADSR release and and you’ll have an airy, electric, ethereal, ‘other-worldly’ tone pad. This sound took a lot of effort to isolate and optimize the 7 different bulb hits to granulate. It came out pretty smooth except for a few notes around C6 that are a bit choppy. The filament resonance is exaggerated in this mix. The original 7 ‘takes’ were played at regular speed, mixed with a second set of 7 that were progressively time-stretched as the notes played on. There’s a Penrose Machine Loop at the very end of each sample, giving a faint whisper of the tone at the end, like a reverb that goes on forever. This really cool sound mix is now pitched and multisampled to play in any register and and in any key. Enjoy!",7.04177,

Tom says: Try fading this sound in past the bulb hit and with lots of ADSR release and and you’ll have an airy, electric, ethereal, ‘other-worldly’ tone pad. This sound took a lot of effort to isolate and optimize the 7 different bulb hits to granulate. It came out pretty smooth except for a few notes around C6 that are a bit choppy. The filament resonance is exaggerated in this mix. The original 7 ‘takes’ were played at regular speed, mixed with a second set of 7 that were progressively time-stretched as the notes played on. There’s a Penrose Machine Loop at the very end of each sample, giving a faint whisper of the tone at the end, like a reverb that goes on forever. This really cool sound mix is now pitched and multisampled to play in any register and and in any key. Enjoy!",7.01379,

Tom says: Try fading this sound in past the bulb hit and with lots of ADSR release and and you’ll have an airy, electric, ethereal, ‘other-worldly’ tone pad. This sound took a lot of effort to isolate and optimize the 7 different bulb hits to granulate. It came out pretty smooth except for a few notes around C6 that are a bit choppy. The filament resonance is exaggerated in this mix. The original 7 ‘takes’ were played at regular speed, mixed with a second set of 7 that were progressively time-stretched as the notes played on. There’s a Penrose Machine Loop at the very end of each sample, giving a faint whisper of the tone at the end, like a reverb that goes on forever. This really cool sound mix is now pitched and multisampled to play in any register and and in any key. Enjoy!",7.02263,
