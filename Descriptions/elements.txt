A baby woke up from it. The ice cream man, always playing the same tune on his truck, tries to sell some ice creams quickly, but then it starts to rain and the wind blows. The customers go home quickly.
After a while every now and then a large raindrop falls on the microphones and that gives a nice ticking sound. Now listening back it gives the experience that I am in the rain myself. Eventually I move the equipment carefully so as not to disturb the sound recording too much.
Slowly but surely the storm moves further north. It becomes quiet.

Sound Name:Heavy Thunder Strike - no Rain - QUADRO.wav Duration:62.0013 User:BlueDelta Description:4-channel HQ record of a sudden and heavy thunderstrike without rain in the afternoon of a hot summerday.
The recording equipment was prepared for recording thunder, so there is no distortion, no compression or (auto)gain reduction done by a limiter in the Zoom F8, means the whole dynamic is still there and will be audible by a adequate monitor/audio equipment. ;-)
The sound was not edited or otherwise enhanced with effects.

This file can be used as a intro followed by my other track (link below), which has soft rain at the beginning, before the thunder comes... ;-
